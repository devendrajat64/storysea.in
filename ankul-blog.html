                                            अपना भी एक सफर रहा है, “The unconstructed road to Paris”. Hi, I am Ankul
                                            Prajapati, a physics aspirant and 2020 Mech Eng. graduate SVNIT, from a
                                            small town in Shahdol District, Madhya Pradesh, where, electricity came
                                            after completing my 11th. Throughout school days, I used the kerosene lamp
                                            for late-night study and read the newspaper for seizing the new updates at
                                            local shops or mills. The situation was not always grim here. I also enjoyed
                                            my childhood with nature. I still remembered when I was reading the
                                            newspaper, saw an advertisement of Resonance Cota coaching classes written
                                            “IIT-Chhoo-Lo-Apni-Zindagi”, at that time I was in class 10th. Hopefully
                                            same time I came to know about NTSE and qualified. Later on, I searched
                                            about IIT, NIT and JEE etc and started preparing for it by self. The 11th
                                            and 12th time were full of transformation and changes (Long story) still I
                                            managed to score well in JEE Mains and Board Exam (District 2nd Rank). After
                                            completing school, I always wanted to pursue pure physics and become a
                                            theoretical physicist but my own put a condition of the institutes, If I get
                                            IITs, IISc or IISER then only will choose physics for undergraduate
                                            otherwise will go for engineering and then complete higher study in physics.
                                            Unfortunately, I couldn't able to score well in JEE Advance and finally
                                            decided to choose Mechanical Engineering at NIT Surat. (I won’t write any
                                            college life story, which is as usual and I also enjoyed a lot) Till first
                                            year I was not aware that, in future engineering degree would not be
                                            admitted at most of the institution for physics master or PhD. When I got to
                                            know all the scenario, somehow, I able to survive and started hunting for
                                            opportunities to the student like me. In the 1st and 2nd year of BTech spent
                                            more than 50% time sitting in front of a laptop and doing research and
                                            finding my interest.

                                            After discerning my interest in astrophysics and cosmology worked on a few
                                            projects. After spending the whole one year understood that it's not my cup
                                            of tea because of lots of data analysis work involved in astrophysics. Later
                                            on, I explored my second area of interest that is Quantum Technology and
                                            sustaining the same. At the edge of the first year, I conceived let's see if
                                            some student chapter can help me in strengthening the profile but found
                                            worthless. This was the time when I believed to found a research
                                            organisation dedicated to undergraduate research work and finally with 4
                                            other students founded a research group named Bose.X, a mission to prepare
                                            multiple S N Bose or CV Raman like a scientist for India <a

                                                (https://www.bosex.org/about-us) </a> and currently, it is consisting of
                                            25 core-noncore members.

                                            Time was dragging very fast and till second year I didn’t have any clear
                                            path on what to do. Luckily, in the second year of course, during winter, I
                                            received an acceptance for a course by Indian Academy of Science where I
                                            joined many renowned scientists including Royal Society of London fellows.
                                            And this was the turning point as few of them advised to write research
                                            papers to get selected at the best physics institute and the day onwards, I
                                            started working my own with other junior friends under Bose.X group. In the
                                            second year again could not get a physics internship and joined at Cryogenic
                                            Engineering Centre IIT KGP, where I had the opportunity to work on semi
                                            cryogenic rocket engine, the obtained results have been already published in
                                            reputed Journal and International conferences. The same result presented at
                                            an ISRO conference and this was my first conference. I believe in practical
                                            of life and self-motivation. In this conference there were no other
                                            undergraduate students, this got me a very high thrust of motivation which
                                            was kindled after meeting with Missile Woman Dr Tessy Thomas and Brahmos CEO
                                            Dr Mishra. During the third year, I continued in quantum technology and
                                            worked on the quantum dot-based photovoltaics and presented a few papers in
                                            international conferences. Also selected for UNESCO funded conference held
                                            at International Centre for Theoretical Physics Italy. After the third year,
                                            I was expecting to get an intern abroad but due to funding issue could not.
                                            So, decided to be in India and offered for three internships (IUCAA, IISc
                                            and BARC). According to the project and area of interest, I decided to go
                                            for IUCAA where I worked with Dr Joydeep Bagchi (Lead discoverer of farthest
                                            known supercluster Saraswati). For the last three year of the BTech, I
                                            sweated in many research projects and published the obtained theoretical and
                                            computational results at a total of eight reputed National-International
                                            Conferences and journals including “Springer Nature”. Most of the work
                                            completed autonomously.

                                            Now the time came when I have to decide whether to go for direct PhD or
                                            Master. As I was not thoroughly ready for writing the Physics GRE (There are
                                            two separate papers 1st General and 2nd Subjective, PCM) so I left with only
                                            European and Australian universities. Before applying for the next degree, I
                                            was owning a total of 8 research papers (5 Conf + 3 Journals) so I was quite
                                            confident about the selection. And finally, till date got the offer from ANU
                                            Australia (QS W Ranking 31), NUS Singapore (QS W Ranking 11), Sorbonne
                                            University (Physics Research USN World Ranking 17) & Ecole Polytechnique
                                            France, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology Germany, KTH Royal Sweden and the
                                            Sapienza University of Rome in Physics. Some of having full funding also.
                                            Most probably I will be joining Ecole or Sorbonne in Paris, France. This was
                                            all about the Turbulences of the shift from Engineering to Physics and now
                                            onwards no more Mechanical guess what next?

                                                When you work on some unprecedented path, it’s obvious you can’t get
                                                instant results, you have to be in same for a long period, to do it
                                                successfully self-motivation is the only sign. Believe me, nowhere extra
                                                talent is expected, just you have to invest your time with allegiance,
                                                the result will defiantly come. So, build your well-framed path by
                                                connecting arbitrary dots and let everyone know.
